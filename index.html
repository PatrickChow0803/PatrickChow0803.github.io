<p><h2>Welcome to my website. I'm Patrick Chow, an aspiring Android Developer.</h2></p>
<p><h3>I have been programming for over 5 years now with C++ being my first language.<br>
I later switched to Java and then Kotlin to help improve my Android career.<br>
My dream is to publish game / education apps onto the Google Store ever since I started learning Android.<br>
Some of my favorite apps that I have created are my Anywhere Fitness app, My PokemonAPI app, and my OOP app that uses Age of Empire API.<br>

The Anywhere Fitness app allows users to sign up for Fitness courses whenever and wherever.<br>
The PokemonAPI app takes in data from a PokemonAPI and lets the users search for Pokemon by either ID or Name<br>
The OOP app takes in data from an Age of Empire API but this app follows the concepts of OOP heavily and uses Model View View Model Architecture<br>
All of these apps have been build using Android Studios with Kotlin being the main language<br><br>
